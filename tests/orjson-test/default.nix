  # The expected behavior if you build on non-excluded would be `maturin` complaining
  # that `pyproject.toml` does not contain `project.{name,repository,requires-python,classifier}`
  # and `Cargo.toml` does (as they seem to deprecate the old way)
  #
  # Some ways to work around this is:
  # 1. pin to previous nixpkgs (up to user)
  # 2. somehow override maturin build hook to use older version of maturin
  # 3. we maintain patches against pyproject.toml and cargo.toml to make the
  # source works, based on read version.
