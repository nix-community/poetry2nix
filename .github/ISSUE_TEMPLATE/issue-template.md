<!--
Is this an issue in the style of "package "X fails to build"?

Most such issues aren't issues in poetry2nix as such, but rather an incomplete dependency specification.
We don't have the capacity to act on most such issues, they often require domain knowledge and they generate noise in the issue tracker.

Please take a look into known edge cases (https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/blob/master/docs/edgecases.md),
maybe it's already solved or you find an inspiration for your own solution.
If you did not found your issue in list of known, then it will be more productive, faster and creates less burden on maintainer
if you first try to discuss your case in Matrix chat (you can find information about it in README).
Community will happily help to find soulution and if needed create issue or pull request
-->

### Describe the issue
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen. -->
