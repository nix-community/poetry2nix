# Edge cases

## Preamble

The Python ecosystem has a very long history. Over the years, an uncountable number of modules have been created, but more importantly, the assembly technology of these modules has changed many times. `ez_install`, `setuptools`, `distutils`, eggs, `pip`, wheels, PEP-518, PEP-517, `flit`, `poetry`. All this diversity creates great difficulties. Poetry, on the one hand, being a build system, can abandon the setuptools and distutils formats, but at the same time, being a dependency installation and management system, it must support all current distribution technologies. And it can do this without revealing the internal structure and the machinery behind curtains. In other words, when you use Poetry, both `setuptools`, `pip` and other build tools can be used to install some modules, and this happens without formally declaring dependence on these tools.

All these factors can cause the module not to be assembled or installed in a certain environment. Nix is a much stricter ecosystem, it has more formal requirements, but at the same time more guarantees. And since `poetry2nix` relies on Nix and its strict rules in its work, there are many rough edges and inaccuracies in the metadata on pypi.org leads to errors.
This is very sad, and we will inevitably face the fact that some modules can not be installed, can not be built, or just cause errors, have unnecessary or missing direct and transitive dependencies. However, Nix is a very flexible system that allows you to modify some aspects of the module with pinpoint accuracy, without changing the source code of the module (and sometimes changing it). This is what this section is dedicated to. We have tried to collect here and describe typical errors and ways to eliminate them.

## Cases

#### ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'PACKAGENAME'

**Conditions:** You have declared a Python package dependency. And this package uses one of the build tools mentioned above (setuptools, pdm, etc.). Since poetry2nix prefers to build from source it requires the build tool. And thatâ€™s when the error occurs.

**Solution:** In order to make the dependency build, we need to override its build dependencies by adding the `PACKAGENAME` package to it.

**Example:** Let's consider the situation when our package has declared `django-floppyforms` as a dependency in `pyproject.toml`, which uses `PACKAGENAME` to be built. And we have this declaration in our Nix definition:

``` nix
poetry2nix.mkPoetryApplication {
  projectDir = ./.;
}
```

And trying to build it results in the following error log

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'setuptools'

error (ignored): error: cannot unlink '/tmp/nix-build-python3.10-django-4.1.3.drv-1/Django-4.1.3': Directory not empty
error: 1 dependencies of derivation '/nix/store/hz4b87s99s1lwiz2m0vwilhlh6rlfj64-python3-3.10.8-env.drv' failed to build

```

As you can see on the fourth last line it's missing `setuptools` which in this case is our missing `PACKAGENAME`.

</details>

In order to be able to build `django-floppyforms` we should modify our nix definition as follows:

``` nix
poetry2nix.mkPoetryApplication {
  projectDir = ./.;
  overrides = poetry2nix.defaultPoetryOverrides.extend
    (final: prev: {
      django-floppyforms = prev.django-floppyforms.overridePythonAttrs
      (
        old: {
          buildInputs = (old.buildInputs or [ ]) ++ [ prev.setuptools ];
        }
      );
    });
}
```

This override will instruct the underlying build logic to include the additional build dependency into the inputs of `django-floppyforms`.
It might help to know that you don't need to use the full package name like `python39Packages.setuptools` but can just use `setuptools` directly.
Be aware that the package names are normalized according to PEP-517, so something like `flit_scm` becomes `flit-scm`.

It can happen that you need multiple overrides for your project, just work through one after the other and your project should build at the end.
Your file might then look something like this:

``` nix
poetry2nix.mkPoetryApplication {
  projectDir = ./.;
  overrides = poetry2nix.defaultPoetryOverrides.extend
    (final: prev: {
      first-dependency = prev.first-dependency.overridePythonAttrs
      (
        old: {
          buildInputs = (old.buildInputs or [ ]) ++ [ prev.buildtools ];
        }
      );
      second-dependency = prev.second-dependency.overridePythonAttrs
      (
        old: {
          buildInputs = (old.buildInputs or [ ]) ++ [ prev.pdm-backend ];
        }
      );
    });
}
```

If you need very many of these overrides or you need to use them twice, consider using something like this. It has less repetition:

```nix
let
  pypkgs-build-requirements = {
    tox = [ "hatchling" "hatch-vcs" ];
    universal-pathlib = [ "flit-core" ];
    pygithub = [ "setuptools-scm" ];
    beautifulsoup4 = [ "hatchling" ];
    xyzservices = [ "setuptools" ];
    simpervisor = [ "setuptools" ];
    pandas = [ "versioneer" ];
  };
  p2n-overrides = p2n.defaultPoetryOverrides.extend (final: prev:
    builtins.mapAttrs (package: build-requirements:
      (builtins.getAttr package prev).overridePythonAttrs (old: {
        buildInputs = (old.buildInputs or [ ]) ++ (builtins.map (pkg: if builtins.isString pkg then builtins.getAttr pkg prev else pkg) build-requirements);
      })
    ) pypkgs-build-requirements
  );
in
  poetry2nix.mkPoetryApplication {
    projectDir = ./.;
    overrides = p2n-overrides;
  }
```

We recommend that you contribute your changes to `poetry2nix` so that other users can profit from them as well.
The specific file with the upstream overrides is [build-systems.json](https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/blob/master/overrides/build-systems.json). It is a simple JSON file which contains the overrides in an array and sorted in alphabetical order.

#### ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement [package spec] (from [package]) (from versions: none)

[Example error message](https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/issues/921):

> ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement python-ulid<2.0.0,>=1.1.0 (from linz-logger) (from versions: none)
> ERROR: No matching distribution found for python-ulid<2.0.0,>=1.1.0

[Quoting @adisbladis](https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/issues/921#issuecomment-1373764661):

> This is usually because of setuptools-scm. I'd try adding an override for [the package mentioned in the package spec]. It might be sufficient to simply add setuptools-scm.

Resulting override:

```nix
{
  python-ulid = prev.python-ulid.overridePythonAttrs (
    old: {
      nativeBuildInputs = (old.nativeBuildInputs or [ ]) ++ [ final.setuptools-scm ];
    }
  );
}
```

#### Errors that are related to Rust and Cargo

**Please update `getCargoHash` and there is a stanza that gives out the hash**

This has known solution <https://github.com/nix-community/poetry2nix/pull/1116>

Though, the solution still needs human-in-a-loop as there are many cases where
there is no expected hash provided.

There are then 2 ways you can solve this while waiting for the PR to merge:

1. Pin the package to a previous working version

This works for transitive package as well, say you have `foo` that depends on
`bar 1.0.1`, but we have `getCargoHash` for `bar 1.0.0`. You can pin `bar`
on your `pyproject.toml` directly

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
#...
# NB: this must be = and without any `^` prefix
bar = "1.0.0"
```

(Remember to `poetry lock`)

2. Pin `poetry2nix` to your branch

If you have created a PR, you probably have a fork of `poetry2nix` under your branch.
In this case, assuming you use `flake`, here's an insight on what this would look
like

```nix
# flake.nix
{
  inputs.poetry2nix.url = "github:your-username/poetry2nix/add-bar-1_0_1";
  inputs.nixpkgs.url = "your-pinned-nixpkgs";
  outputs = {nixpkgs, poetry2nix, ...}: let
    # NOTE: your mileage may vary, if you use other flake frameworks like flake-utils
    # or flake-parts, you should have `pkgs` or `pkgs'`
    pkgs = import nixpkgs {system = "your-system";};
    pkgs_overriden = pkgs.appendOverlays [ poetry2nix.overlays.default ];
  in {
    packages = pkgs_overriden.poetry2nix.mkPoetryApplication {
      projectDir = ./.;
    };
  };
}
```

**Use `preferWheels` and call it a day**

We have many issues come in thanks to the recent boom of maturin and setuptools-rust.

While the ecosystem is growing, we have an escape hatch to use `preferWheels`
if you trust pip wheel dists. `preferWheels` is basically Python's version of
compiled binary, so it is vulnerable to supply chain attacks.

```nix
poetry2nix.mkPoetryApplication {
  projectDir = ./.;
  preferWheels = true;
}
```

Though, we would really appreciate a GitHub issue for your use-case.

#### Nix evaluation errors

1. Enable `--show-trace`.
2. Remove packages from the `pyproject.toml`, `rm poetry.lock && nix shell nixpkgs#poetry --command poetry lock`.
3. Try running poetry2nix again.

By these means, one can bisect the package-set to find the problematic package.

One error you might run into is an "infinite recursion encountered." If this error indicates this happens happens `while evaluating the attribute 'propagatedBuildInputs' of the derivation 'python${version}-${pkg_name}'`, then it is possible `${pkg_name}` has a recursive dependency.

For example, this is the abbreviated error message if I try to install `dask[distributed]`:

```
error: infinite recursion encountered
       â€¦ while evaluating the attribute 'propagatedBuildInputs' of the derivation 'python3.11-distributed-2023.3.2'
       â€¦ while evaluating the attribute 'propagatedBuildInputs' of the derivation 'python3.11-dask-2023.3.2'
       â€¦ while evaluating the attribute 'propagatedBuildInputs' of the derivation 'python3.11-main-0.1.0'
```

This is because `dask[distributed]` depends on `distributed` which depends on `dask`. The solution is to install `dask` (no extras) and `distributed` separately.

#### Overriding package versions

Typically, all versions of a package that `poetry2nix` brings in are found in the `poetry.lock` file.

If you choose to override the package version for a particular dependency using nix, you may get a package that doesn't match the lock file.

Suppose you had the following `poetry.lock` file:

```toml
[[package]]
name = "foobar"
version = "1.0"
description = "A dummy package"
optional = false
python-versions = ">=3.7"
files = [
    {file = "foobar-1.0-py3-none-any.whl", hash = "sha256:ae74fb96c20a0277a1d615f1e4d73c8414f5a98db8b799a7931d1582f3390c28"},
]
```

Suppose we override the version in our Nix file as follows:

```nix
let poetryOverrides = final: prev: {
    foobar = prev.foobar.overridePythonAttrs (old: rec {
      version = "2.0";
      src = prev.pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
        owner = "fakerepo";
        repo = "foobar";
        rev = "refs/tags/${version}";
        sha256 = lib.fakeSha256;
      };
    });
  };
in
poetry2nix.mkPoetryApplication {
  projectDir = ../.;
  overrides = poetry2nix.overrides.withDefaults poetryOverrides;
}
```

The poetry application will build successfully **but** the version that is selected for the package `foobar` is **2.0** although `poetry.lock` says **1.0**.

**TL;DR**: Overrides supersede `poetry.lock`.
